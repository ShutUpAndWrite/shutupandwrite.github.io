<h2 id="community-goings-on">Community goings-on</h2>
<p>Unlike most Reddit communities, which are based on finding and submitting content, Shut Up &amp; Write is more focused on fostering useful writing discussion and helping you to meet your own personal goals.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-threads">Discussion threads</h3>
<p>The perfect place to jump in and introduce yourself. JotBot posts these threads weekly and goes into more detail about what is acceptable content in each on the posts themselves. Each post category has its own browseable archive of weeks past linked in the post itself. Here's a brief overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing Checkpoint</strong> (Mondays): A place to set your writing goals for the week and have a look at how well you did last week.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestion Box</strong> (Wednesdays): Have a suggestion or an idea for the community? Toss it in!</li>
<li><strong>Story Analysis</strong> (Thursdays): A place to talk about what you're reading (or watching, or listening to) and what you're learning from it.</li>
<li><strong>Stupid Questions</strong> (Sundays): A thread for all the questions that don't fit the <a href="#what-makes-a-good-question">usual criteria</a>. If you have a small question that you don't think deserves its own thread, ask it here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="word-war-weekend">Word War Weekend</h3>
<p>Every weekend, we do hourly <a href="#word-sprints">timed word sprints</a> in the <a href="#chat">official community chat</a>. These word sprints take place every hour on the hour and last for 30 minutes apiece, so you'll always know when one is going or when the next one is.</p>
<p>While a word sprint is on, all participants draft as quickly as they possibly can, and once it's over, they reveal how much they've written. The "winner" of each sprint is whoever wrote the most words. Then everyone gets a half-hour break before it starts over again!</p>
<p>Word War Weekend starts at exactly midnight Saturday UTC time and ends at exactly midnight Monday UTC time. For reference, that's a start time of 8pm Friday EST (5pm Friday PST) and an end time of 8pm Sunday EST (5pm Sunday PST).</p>
<p>Read up on <a href="#word-sprints">word sprints</a> and join in sometime next weekend! It's a fun way of keeping yourself motivated to write with a little friendly competition.</p>
<h3 id="bad-fanfic-night">Bad Fanfic Night</h3>
<p>The first ever Bad Fanfic Night will be taking place shortly, at which point this section will be expanded. The gist of it though is that it will be like a Bad Movie Night, but with fanfiction. Everyone takes turns reading bad fanfic aloud on our TeamSpeak server.</p>
<p>Incidentally, SU&amp;W doesn't have anything against fanfiction in general, which is why this is explicitly called <em>Bad</em> Fanfic Night. Fanfic happens to be the easiest writing to get ahold of in large quantities, however.</p>
<h3 id="words-imperfect">Words Imperfect</h3>
<p>A podcast where people submit their writing to awk (the guy who runs all this crazy stuff), and awk makes fun of it in the most unjustified manner possible. The first episodes should be coming up soon, at which point this, too, will be expanded.</p>
<h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
<p>Unlike most Reddit communities, <strong>Shut Up &amp; Write</strong> features a <strong>reputation system</strong>. By performing certain actions that are beneficial to the community, you can earn <strong>reputation points</strong>, which can either be used to <a href="#addlink">ask for feedback</a> or to <a href="#addlink">reward content</a> that you find interesting or helpful.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to have negative reputation, nor is it possible to "lose" reputation through unfavorable actions. Reputation can only be "spent" on certain actions.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-reputation">Viewing reputation</h3>
<p>Reputation is displayed as your user flair in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite">/r/shutupandwrite</a>. Your most up-to-date flair is always the flair displayed in the sidebar.</p>
<p>If you have no flair, you can safely assume you have no reputation points yet. You must perform an action that would either cost or earn you reputation to get a flair.</p>
<p>Due to processing lag, others' flairs may not always be completely up to date, or may appear different on separate posts and comments. This is normal; eventually, Reddit's page cache will update and the flairs will be consistent again.</p>
<h3 id="requesting-feedback">Requesting feedback</h3>
<p>All users can post one feedback request for free. Subsequent requests cost <strong>20 rep</strong> to post.</p>
<p>To request feedback, click the "Request Feedback" button in the sidebar, and fill out the appropriate information. It is very important that you read through these guidelines at least once before submitting your request. There's quite a few of them, but following them will make sure that your feedback request is answered more quickly, and will make the experience generally more pleasant for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Once responses start filtering in, you can decide whether or not they were helpful and <a href="#rewarding-feedback">reward them accordingly</a>. The integrity of our feedback system is dependent on authors dictating which feedback was genuinely helpful, and is the main source of reputation for the community.</p>
<h4 id="dos-and-donts-for-feedback-requests">Do's and don'ts for feedback requests</h4>
<p>These are <strong>mandatory criteria</strong> and will result in your post being removed if they are not met.</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include [feedback] somewhere in the title.</strong> Failure to do so will prevent JotBot from recognizing it as a feedback thread, meaning you won't be able to give points to anyone who responds. Also, requests for feedback are not allowed outside of the official feedback system, so your post will be removed.</li>
<li><strong>Put your word count in the title.</strong> Being up-front about your wordcount will help others match up their current attention span with your work.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the purpose of the piece.</strong> Is it an excerpt? A poem? A stand-alone short story? Something you're planning on submitting to a magazine? Context helps tremendously. A middle chapter from a novel can look like a pointless short story if you don't tell anyone what it is.</li>
<li><strong>Format your piece sensibly.</strong> No one wants to read a giant block of text.</li>
<li><strong>Leave comments.</strong> Even if the responses you received on your feedback post aren't worthy of a <code>(+)</code>, please leave a comment acknowledging that you at least read the responses (and, if you like, why you don't feel the response warrants a reward).</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DON'T ASK US TO IGNORE ISSUES YOU ALREADY KNOW ARE PRESENT IN YOUR WRITING.</strong> If you know you submission has issues, and you can fix them yourself without outside input, <em>fix them</em>. A post asking for readers to ignore blatant errors is unacceptable.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T SUBMIT NON-WRITING.</strong> No outlines, no story ideas. We're here to critique writing, not thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T make a post whose only purpose is to give away reputation points for doing nothing.</strong> Having a thread that's not <em>really</em> a feedback thread, but rather an excuse to give out rep points like candy, defeats the whole purpose of a reputation-based system.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T put pieces &gt; 500 words in the body of a self-post.</strong> If your piece is under 500 words and you do include it in a self-post, double-check that you've got the formatting right. If you're linking to your piece, make sure wherever you've put it is somewhere readable and convenient for others to use. Stories hosted on sites with eye-gouging design or that require signups will be removed. When in doubt, use <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> (rich text, Microsoft-Word-esque) or <a href="http://pastebin.com">Pastebin</a> (plain text only).</li>
<li><strong>DON'T sockpuppet.</strong> Yes, the one-free-post policy means you could theoretically create an infinite number of new accounts and never have to give feedback for the rest of your sorry, miserable life. We're all very proud of you for working that out, but if you're going to try to exploit the reputation system, do it in a more creative way.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T ask if a piece is "worth continuing," or other questions that serve only to seek validation from others.</strong> The only person who can decide if your piece is worth continuing is you. Feedback may be able to help you make the decision, but no individual person can answer that question besides yourself, and if this is the only thing you want feedback on, it's not a worthwhile feedback post.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="not-mandatory-but-good-ideas">Not mandatory, but good ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your submissions short.</strong> 3,500 words is about the maximum you can reasonably expect someone to give a detailed critique about. You can try for longer, but don't expect a miracle.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid posting first drafts.</strong> If you're posting a piece the same day you've spat it out, or without having at least read through it once or twice, you're asking others to do work that you should have done yourself. The purpose of feedback is to pick up where your own efforts left off. Something hot off the typewriter can almost certainly be improved by a second look before asking others to read it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="giving-feedback">Giving feedback</h3>
<p>The best feedback is an accurate description of your reading experience. The more specific you can get about your reactions to the piece and <em>why</em> you reacted that way, the better your feedback will be.</p>
<p>General tips for giving feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you see something, say something.</strong> Keep the poster's specific requests in mind, but don't completely ignore all other problems. If they wanted feedback on pacing but they can't use a semicolon to save their life, <em>mention it</em>. Even if you have a complaint about a tiny detail, don't assume it was intentional on the author's part or that he/she will catch it themselves later. We only ask that you emphasize the kind of feedback that the poster requested, not disregard all other aspects entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be concerned about being "right."</strong> If you can justify why you think something is working or not working, that's good enough, even if you're the only one who thinks so. Most feedback requests will have multiple people expressing their views on it, so don't worry about biasing the author towards something you're afraid is just your personal taste. Remember, the point of feedback is to get a variety of opinions, so don't concern yourself with "accuracy." Just explain your points and you'll be fine.</li>
<li><strong>Read the majority of the piece before leaving feedback.</strong> Unless there is something blatantly wrong, try to make it through at least half of a piece before giving feedback, especially if the request was for general feedback. Giving feedback on only the first line or sentence usually isn't very helpful!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your feedback <strong>may be removed and ineligible for earning rep</strong> if it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low effort.</strong> And by this, we don't mean "how dare you not leave a line-by-line critique." General critique and the like is fine, especially if that's what was requested. Sometimes your crit will only be a paragraph or so long, and that's okay! Don't pad your feedback because of this rule. By low effort we mean <em>incredibly</em> low effort, like, a single sentence that says "I didn't read this because it was boring." or "I hate stories about cats." Don't do that.</li>
<li><strong>A generic "I liked it"/"I didn't like it" comment.</strong> You might think you're being nice by telling someone their writing is great, but they're here for data, not validation (hopefully, anyway). Feel free to talk about the specific reasons <em>why</em> you liked or didn't like something, but a general yea/nay on a piece doesn't get anyone anywhere. If you find yourself typing out a comment that doesn't go into any detail or explain the reasons about why you felt the way you felt about a piece, stop and come back to it later when you can look at it more objectively.</li>
<li><strong>Completely divergent from the poster's request(s).</strong> Don't lose sight of what was asked for. Double-check the post and see what the requester wanted feedback on, and make sure you've at least tried to touch on what they requested.</li>
<li><strong>Only a reference to privately-given feedback.</strong> Feedback should be public. Comments to the effect of "check your inbox, I left feedback there" are not eligible for earning reputation.</li>
<li><strong>A critique of others' subjective feedback.</strong> Contradicting others' feedback is expected &mdash; encouraged, even, because it gives the requester a greater variety of opinions to work with &mdash; but do it in a way that is clearly directed at the requester, not at the person giving feedback. Otherwise, threads can quickly spiral into arguments about which opinion was "right." That said, if there is something objectively wrong with the feedback (for example, if it violates any of these rules) feel free to link the person to this page and/or report the feedback to mods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rewarding-feedback">Rewarding feedback</h3>
<p>If a piece of feedback has been helpful to you, you can reward that feedback by replying to it and including a <code>(+)</code> symbol in your comment. Note that editing <code>(+)</code> into an already existing comment will not work.</p>
<p>Please note that while responding to all feedback is a good idea, you are not required to reward every piece of feedback you get. As a general rule, you should only reward feedback that has been personally helpful for you.</p>
<p>If you do not consider the feedback you receive to be helpful, you may withhold your points for as long as you like. If you have not rewarded anyone in the thread, your first reward will increase in value by 10 rep per day up to a maximum of 50 rep after 5 days. This "bounty" system is meant to incentivize feedback even if the request is particularly difficult to fulfill.</p>
<p>You can reward as many or as few of the responses as you like. Just be aware that one person cannot be rewarded more than once in the same thread. Regardless of whether or not you reward anyone, replying to all the feedback you get is considered the polite thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="transferring-points-also-known-as-tipping">Transferring points <small>(also known as "tipping")</small></h3>
<p>If you have rep and would like to thank another user or reward them for posting good content to the community, you can transfer or "tip" some reputation from your account to theirs by replying to their post or comment with the following syntax.</p>
<p><code>+/u/JotBot 5rep</code></p>
<p>The above example would transfer 5 reputation points from your account to the account that created the comment or post to which you replied.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-question">What makes a good question?</h3>
<p>Any questions related to writing are allowed, so long as they are <strong>not</strong> about one of the following topics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation.</strong> Nothing interesting ever comes of a discussion about motivation, staying motivated, getting motivated, or motivating someone else. Besides, it's barely connected with writing. The question "How can I get motivated to write?" could be answered in much the same way as if you'd asked it with just about any other activity.</li>
<li><strong>Ideas.</strong> This comes in two flavors: "How do you get ideas?" and "What do you guys think of this idea?" The answer to the first one has been answered hundreds of times over by authors all across space and time, so you'd do better looking up their answers than asking us for ours. And for the second, virtually no ideas are good or bad &mdash; the goodness or badness comes in the idea's execution. Go write your idea, then come back.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming.</strong> Or to put it another way: don't ask us a question that only applies to your specific story. "I don't know what to do with this character, can anyone help?" is not really a question, but a thinly-veiled attempt to get the community to do the work for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you absolutely must ask a question that fits into one of these categories, or you're not sure whether or not your question qualifies, the <a href="#discussion-threads">Stupid Questions Thread</a> is your friend. Unlike questions that start a new thread, pretty much anything goes in Stupid Questions. Find the latest Stupid Questions post and knock yourself out.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-content-post">What makes a good content post?</h3>
<p>Unlike every other category of post, content posts are very open-ended, which makes this question difficult to answer. In general you should lurk the community for a while before attempting your first content post to get a handle on what they'll find interesting.</p>
<p>In general, there are two good types of posts: resources and analysis.</p>
<p>A <strong>resource post</strong> is a post that links or names one or more outside resources having to do with writing. Often, just linking a resource is not enough, which is part of the reason link posts are disabled on this subreddit. You must also give at least a few sentences of reasoning why you think this resource is a good thing to bring to the community's attention.</p>
<p>That's vague, and intentionally so. Given the proper context, a resource could be anything &mdash; a word reference, a YouTube video, a webapp, even an entire book. You could reference a single thing or a hundred. Expect to be able to defend its usefulness to the community if it is called into question.</p>
<p>An <strong>analysis post</strong> is essentially an essay in which the author has chosen to analyze something related to writing or storytelling. That could be a book, a movie, another essay, a trend, a commonly held belief among writers, a trope, a quirk of grammar &mdash; nearly anything you can imagine. These are often quite long, but provoke discussion that can go on for some time.</p>
<p>Particularly good content will be featured on the <strong>Shut Up &amp; Write Official Blog</strong>... once it exists. (I'm working on it - awk)</p>
<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p><strong>IRC</strong>, or <strong>Internet Relay Chat</strong>, is a method of talking with people over the Internet via text. It is one of the oldest methods of communication on the Internet, and is still in use to this very day, with thousands of channels spread across hundreds of servers in dozens of networks, each of them about a different subject with a different community and a different set of rules.</p>
<p>Our corner of this massive network of communications is known as <code>#shutupandwrite</code>, hosted on the IRC network known as Snoonet (<code>irc.snoonet.org</code>). As you might expect, we talk mostly about writing, but the discussion here is a lot more casual than what you'll find on the subreddit.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h3>
<p>Click the "Join Chat" button in the sidebar, or click <a href="http://goo.gl/xHO16r">this magical link</a> that goes to exactly the same place. Introduce yourself and please be patient &mdash; all chatting is done in real-time and not everyone in the chat has their eyes glued to this one particular window 24/7. Expect to lurk a bit before you get a reply.</p>
<h3 id="irc-controls">IRC controls</h3>
<p>This is by no means a comprehensive list of all IRC commands, but these are the commands you'll likely be using the most.</p>
<table>

</tr>
<tr>

<h3 id="jotbot-controls">JotBot controls</h3>
<p>You'll find JotBot in the IRC as well as the subreddit. Here, he announces activity on the subreddit, has a variety of (mostly) useful functions for reference purposes, and runs word sprints.</p>
<p>If you want to give JotBot a parameter that has spaces in it, either include the parameter "in quotes" or use an_underscore. So for example, <code>!define some example</code> would result in JotBot trying to define <code>some</code> and not <code>some example</code>; <code>!define "some example"</code> or <code>!define some_example</code> , on the other hand, would work as expected.</p>
<h4 id="reference-commands">Reference commands</h4>
<p>Use these as much as you want, but not in a sophomoric fashion (i.e. purposefully trying to get the bot to say naughty things). As is true of most JotBot commands, they work if you private message JotBot as well (e.g. <code>/msg JotBot !trope</code>).</p>

<h4 id="word-sprints">Word sprints</h4>
<p>Originally inspired by <a href="http://www.goodchatting.com/articles/bjguide/">BattleJesus of NaNoWriMo fame</a>, word sprints are a timed writing exercise in which the goal is to draft as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>To start a sprint, use the command <code>!sprint</code>. By default, this will create a word sprint 30 minutes long that will begin 5 minutes after the command is run. You can optionally specify the length of the sprint (<code>!sprint 15</code> would create a 15-minute sprint, for example) or the length of the sprint and the delay before it begins (<code>!sprint 15 2</code> would make the aforementioned 15-minute sprint start in 2 minutes instead of 5).</p>
<p>If you've started a sprint, you will automatically become a participant in that sprint. If you or anyone else uses the <code>!status</code> command, JotBot will print a message telling you whether or not the sprint has started and how long it has to go along with a list of users currently participating in the sprint.</p>
<p>To join a word sprint that someone else has made, type <code>!join</code>. To leave, use <code>!leave</code>.</p>
<p>To report your wordcount at any time, use the <code>!wc</code> command followed by your wordcount. For example, <code>!wc 42</code> would set your wordcount to 42.</p>
<p>Handily, setting your wordcount before a sprint begins will not count towards your wordcount during the sprint. In other words, if you have a document with 100 words written, using the command <code>!wc 100</code> before the sprint starts will set your initial wordcount to 100 instead of the default, 0. Then, after the sprint starts, if you set your wordcount to 300, JotBot will automatically subtract your initial wordcount from that (in this case, 100) and report the amount of words you wrote during the sprint (in this case, 200).</p>
<p>If the sprint has already begun and you want to set your initial wordcount, use the <code>!wc reset</code> command. <code>!wc reset 100</code> will set your initial (pre-sprint) wordcount to 100.</p>
<p>If you are the owner of a sprint and want to cancel a sprint for any reason, use the <code>!close</code> command. If you are not the owner, the <code>!close</code> command will do nothing. If the current owner loses connection or leaves the channel, ownership passes down to the next available participant. If there are no available participants, JotBot will set a self-destruct timer of one minute to prevent the sprint from going on without anyone in it. The sprint's current owner is always listed in bold when viewing the participant list through the <code>!status</code> command.</p>
<p>Once the sprint concludes, all participants will have five minutes to finalize their wordcount with the <code>!final</code> command. Once everyone has finalized (or if five minutes has passed), JotBot will announce the winner of the sprint &mdash; the person who wrote the most.</p>
<p>You can also finalize your wordcount early if you have to leave mid-sprint. JotBot will remember a finalized wordcount even if you leave.</p>
<p>Sprints are just for fun, something to get you motivated and writing alongside others (or just against the clock). All wordcount reporting is based on the honor system &mdash; no writing needs to be shared. It's a friendly, small, and above all friendly bit of competition where everyone is a winner for having gotten further in their drafts (but especially the winner).</p>
<p>Here's what an example word sprint might look like.</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">&lt;SomeUser&gt; !sprint
&lt;JotBot&gt; SomeUser has created a word sprint! This sprint will start in 5 minutes and last for 30 minutes. Type !join to join.
&lt;SprintFanatic&gt; !join
&lt;JotBot&gt; SprintFanatic has joined the word sprint in #shutupandwrite.
&lt;SprintFanatic&gt; !wc 42069
&lt;JotBot&gt; SprintFanatic's wordcount is 0 (total: 42069).

...

&lt;JotBot&gt; A word sprint in #shutupandwrite is starting! You have 30 minutes to write as much as you can. Use the !wc command to update your wordcount as you go. To leave, type !leave. Participants: SomeUser (0), SprintFanatic (0)
&lt;SomeUser&gt; !wc 42
&lt;JotBot&gt; SomeUser's wordcount is 42 (total: 42).
&lt;SprintFanatic&gt; !wc 42100
&lt;JotBot&gt; SprintFanatic's wordcount is 31 (total: 42100).

...

&lt;JotBot&gt; The word sprint in #shutupandwrite has ended. You have 5 minutes to finalize your wordcount by typing !final. Participants: SomeUser (42), SprintFanatic (31).
&lt;SomeUser&gt; !final
&lt;JotBot&gt; SomeUser's wordcount has been finalized at 42.
&lt;SprintFanatic&gt; !final 42222
&lt;JotBot&gt; SprintFanatic's wordcount has been finalized at 153.
&lt;JotBot&gt; The winner is SprintFanatic with 153 words written!
</code></pre>

<h4 id="project-storage-alpha">Project storage (alpha)</h4>
<p>More of an experiment than anything else, JotBot has the capability to store some very basic information about your current writing projects, if you so choose. And by "very basic" I mean "literally just the wordcount right now."</p>
<p>If you'd like to view the most recently updated project information, use the <code>!projects</code> command. To store or modify your own, you'll need a Snoonet account so that JotBot knows who you are (see <a href="#irc-controls">IRC controls</a> for more information on that).</p>

<p>If you think this is a bit silly and frivolous, it is, and it's essentially the alpha stage of some much more in-depth project tracking stuff. Hold tight! There'll be more later.</p>
<h3 id="activity-to-avoid">Activity to avoid</h3>
<p>There aren't many rules in IRC. The main idea is to avoid being extremely irritating to the other participants in chat. Some example of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive use of linebreaks. Every time you press enter, another new message is whisked off to the computer of each and every person you see listed in the chat. Please appreciate this dark magic and don't overuse it by spamming the hell out of it.</li>
<li>Constantly asking if <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgrt7XZ-BQw">anyone is around</a>. IRC is two-thirds dead air on a good day. It's something you're meant to keep in the background.</li>
<li>Having multiple connections to the same room. If you frequently switch between devices, consider using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)">bouncer</a> instead.</li>
<li>Changing your nickname a lot. This confuses people about who's who. Then we get more people asking if anyone's around.</li>
<li>Having a client that announces when you are away or back. Apply the "What if everyone had this?" principle and then imagine how much channel spam we'd be dealing with.</li>
<li>Don't use your nickname as a status message. We don't need to know if you're sleeping or cooking or eating or even writing. Stick to one nickname and we'll all be significantly less confused.</li>
<li>Complaining about how stupid the chat is. If you want a discussion about writing, bring it up! It is a chatroom of writers, after all, and it doesn't take much to get us talking about it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="irc-clients">IRC Clients</h3>
<p>There are many ways to get into the #shutupandwrite chat. The <a href="http://goo.gl/xHO16r">sidebar link</a> is the quickest way, but by no means the best. Technically, that link takes you to a client that lives in your web browser known as KiwiIRC. However, there are ways to get to IRC without using a browser at all!</p>
<p>There are a few advantages to this. For one thing, notifications are easier to... well, <em>notice</em> when they're happening outside of your browser. Standalone clients are more customizable and a lot more lightweight than a JavaScript beast chugging away in your browser tab. You can also use them to automatically log yourself into services without having to type your password out every time.</p>
<p>If you're on Windows or Linux, <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> is a great option. <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a> is available for OS X and iOS. <a href="http://www.andchat.net/">AndChat</a> works well for Android phones.</p>
<p>Whichever client you use, you'll want to connect to Snoonet (<code>irc.snoonet.org</code>) and join the <code>#shutupandwrite</code> channel.</p></div>
