Most rules are specific to one kind of content or another, which are covered later on in this document.\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nthe rules of Reddit\n.\n\n\nBe nice to the new folk.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, write it out.\n\n\nDon't try and get the community to do your work for you.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion threads\n\n\nThe perfect place to jump in and introduce yourself. JotBot posts these threads weekly and goes into more detail about what is acceptable content in each on the posts themselves. Each post category has its own browseable archive of weeks past linked in the post itself. Here's a brief overview.\n\n\n\n\nWriting Checkpoint\n (Mondays): A place to set your writing goals for the week and have a look at how well you did last week.\n\n\nSuggestion Box\n (Wednesdays): Have a suggestion or an idea for the community? Toss it in!\n\n\nStory Analysis\n (Thursdays): A place to talk about what you're reading (or watching, or listening to) and what you're learning from it.\n\n\nStupid Questions\n (Sundays): A thread for all the questions that don't fit the \nusual criteria\n. If you have a small question that you don't think deserves its own thread, ask it here.\n\n\n\n\nWords Imperfect\n\n\nThe official community podcast, in which awk asks the fine folk of SU\nW to submit some short (\nvery\n short) stories for him to read out loud and generally be extremely unfair to. If, for some reason, you'd like one of those stories to be yours, keep your eyes peeled for a \nWords Imperfect\n submission thread.\n\n\n\n\nWords Imperfect on Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\nReputation\n\n\nUnlike most Reddit communities, \nShut Up \n Write\n features a \nreputation system\n. By performing certain actions that are beneficial to the community, you can earn \nreputation points\n, which can either be used to \nask for feedback\n or to \nreward content\n that you find interesting or helpful.\n\n\nIt is currently not possible to have negative reputation, nor is it possible to \"lose\" reputation through unfavorable actions. Reputation can only be \"spent\" on certain actions.\n\n\nViewing reputation\n\n\nReputation is displayed as your user flair in \n/r/shutupandwrite\n. Your most up-to-date flair is always the flair displayed in the sidebar.\n\n\nIf you have no flair, you can safely assume you have no reputation points yet. You must perform an action that would either cost or earn you reputation to get a flair.\n\n\nDue to processing lag, others' flairs may not always be completely up to date, or may appear different on separate posts and comments. This is normal; eventually, Reddit's page cache will update and the flairs will be consistent again.\n\n\nTransferring points \n(also known as \"tipping\")\n\n\nIf you have rep and would like to thank another user or reward them for posting good content to the community, you can transfer or \"tip\" some reputation from your account to theirs by replying to their post or comment with the following syntax.\n\n\n+/u/JotBot 5rep\n\n\nThe above example would transfer 5 reputation points from your account to the account that created the comment or post to which you replied.\n\n\nReputation quick reference\n\n\nThis will be expanded for other actions in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving feedback that the author considers helpful\n\n\n+10 rep\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback request\n\n\nFirst is free; subsequent, -20 rep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequesting feedback\n\n\nAll users can post one feedback request for free. Subsequent requests cost \n20 rep\n to post.\n\n\nTo request feedback, click the \"Request Feedback\" button in the sidebar, and fill out the appropriate information. It is very important that you read through these guidelines at least once before submitting your request. There's quite a few of them, but following them will make sure that your feedback request is answered more quickly, and will make the experience generally more pleasant for everyone involved.\n\n\nOnce responses start filtering in, you can decide whether or not they were helpful and \nreward them accordingly\n. The integrity of our feedback system is dependent on authors dictating which feedback was genuinely helpful, and is the main source of reputation for the community.\n\n\nDo's and don'ts for feedback requests\n\n\nThese are \nmandatory criteria\n and will result in your post being removed if they are not met.\n\n\nDo:\n\n\n\n\nInclude [feedback] somewhere in the title.\n Failure to do so will prevent JotBot from recognizing it as a feedback thread, meaning you won't be able to give points to anyone who responds. Also, requests for feedback are not allowed outside of the official feedback system, so your post will be removed.\n\n\nPut your word count in the title.\n Being up-front about your wordcount will help others match up their current attention span with your work.\n\n\nExplain the purpose of the piece.\n Is it an excerpt? A poem? A stand-alone short story? Something you're planning on submitting to a magazine? Context helps tremendously. A middle chapter from a novel can look like a pointless short story if you don't tell anyone what it is.\n\n\nFormat your piece sensibly.\n No one wants to read a giant block of text.\n\n\nLeave comments.\n Even if the responses you received on your feedback post aren't worthy of a \n(+)\n, please leave a comment acknowledging that you at least read the responses (and, if you like, why you don't feel the response warrants a reward).\n\n\n\n\nDon't:\n\n\n\n\nDON'T ASK US TO IGNORE ISSUES YOU ALREADY KNOW ARE PRESENT IN YOUR WRITING.\n If you know you submission has issues, and you can fix them yourself without outside input, \nfix them\n. A post asking for readers to ignore blatant errors is unacceptable.\n\n\nDON'T SUBMIT NON-WRITING.\n No outlines, no story ideas. We're here to critique writing, not thoughts.\n\n\nDON'T make a post whose only purpose is to give away reputation points for doing nothing.\n Having a thread that's not \nreally\n a feedback thread, but rather an excuse to give out rep points like candy, defeats the whole purpose of a reputation-based system.\n\n\nDON'T put pieces \n 500 words in the body of a self-post.\n If your piece is under 500 words and you do include it in a self-post, double-check that you've got the formatting right. If you're linking to your piece, make sure wherever you've put it is somewhere readable and convenient for others to use. Stories hosted on sites with eye-gouging design or that require signups will be removed. When in doubt, use \nGoogle Docs\n (rich text, Microsoft-Word-esque) or \nPastebin\n (plain text only).\n\n\nDON'T sockpuppet.\n Yes, the one-free-post policy means you could theoretically create an infinite number of new accounts and never have to give feedback for the rest of your sorry, miserable life. We're all very proud of you for working that out, but if you're going to try to exploit the reputation system, do it in a more creative way.\n\n\nDON'T ask if a piece is \"worth continuing,\" or other questions that serve only to seek validation from others.\n The only person who can decide if your piece is worth continuing is you. Feedback may be able to help you make the decision, but no individual person can answer that question besides yourself, and if this is the only thing you want feedback on, it's not a worthwhile feedback post.\n\n\n\n\nNot mandatory, but good ideas\n\n\n\n\nKeep your submissions short.\n 3,500 words is about the maximum you can reasonably expect someone to give a detailed critique about. You can try for longer, but don't expect a miracle.\n\n\nAvoid posting first drafts.\n If you're posting a piece the same day you've spat it out, or without having at least read through it once or twice, you're asking others to do work that you should have done yourself. The purpose of feedback is to pick up where your own efforts left off. Something hot off the typewriter can almost certainly be improved by a second look before asking others to read it.\n\n\n\n\nGiving feedback\n\n\nThe best feedback is an accurate description of your reading experience. The more specific you can get about your reactions to the piece and \nwhy\n you reacted that way, the better your feedback will be.\n\n\nGeneral tips for giving feedback:\n\n\n\n\nIf you see something, say something.\n Keep the poster's specific requests in mind, but don't completely ignore all other problems. If they wanted feedback on pacing but they can't use a semicolon to save their life, \nmention it\n. Even if you have a complaint about a tiny detail, don't assume it was intentional on the author's part or that he/she will catch it themselves later. We only ask that you emphasize the kind of feedback that the poster requested, not disregard all other aspects entirely.\n\n\nDon't be concerned about being \"right.\"\n If you can justify why you think something is working or not working, that's good enough, even if you're the only one who thinks so. Most feedback requests will have multiple people expressing their views on it, so don't worry about biasing the author towards something you're afraid is just your personal taste. Remember, the point of feedback is to get a variety of opinions, so don't concern yourself with \"accuracy.\" Just explain your points and you'll be fine.\n\n\nRead the majority of the piece before leaving feedback.\n Unless there is something blatantly wrong, try to make it through at least half of a piece before giving feedback, especially if the request was for general feedback. Giving feedback on only the first line or sentence usually isn't very helpful!\n\n\n\n\nYour feedback \nmay be removed and ineligible for earning rep\n if it is:\n\n\n\n\nLow effort.\n And by this, we don't mean \"how dare you not leave a line-by-line critique.\" General critique and the like is fine, especially if that's what was requested. Sometimes your crit will only be a paragraph or so long, and that's okay! Don't pad your feedback because of this rule. By low effort we mean \nincredibly\n low effort, like, a single sentence that says \"I didn't read this because it was boring.\" or \"I hate stories about cats.\" Don't do that.\n\n\nA generic \"I liked it\"/\"I didn't like it\" comment.\n You might think you're being nice by telling someone their writing is great, but they're here for data, not validation (hopefully, anyway). Feel free to talk about the specific reasons \nwhy\n you liked or didn't like something, but a general yea/nay on a piece doesn't get anyone anywhere. If you find yourself typing out a comment that doesn't go into any detail or explain the reasons about why you felt the way you felt about a piece, stop and come back to it later when you can look at it more objectively.\n\n\nCompletely divergent from the poster's request(s).\n Don't lose sight of what was asked for. Double-check the post and see what the requester wanted feedback on, and make sure you've at least tried to touch on what they requested.\n\n\nOnly a reference to privately-given feedback.\n Feedback should be public. Comments to the effect of \"check your inbox, I left feedback there\" are not eligible for earning reputation.\n\n\nA critique of others' subjective feedback.\n Contradicting others' feedback is expected \n encouraged, even, because it gives the requester a greater variety of opinions to work with \n but do it in a way that is clearly directed at the requester, not at the person giving feedback. Otherwise, threads can quickly spiral into arguments about which opinion was \"right.\" That said, if there is something objectively wrong with the feedback (for example, if it violates any of these rules) feel free to link the person to this page and/or report the feedback to mods.\n\n\n\n\nRewarding feedback\n\n\nIf a piece of feedback has been helpful to you, you can reward that feedback by replying to it and including a \n(+)\n symbol in your comment. Note that editing \n(+)\n into an already existing comment will not work.\n\n\nPlease note that while responding to all feedback is a good idea, you are not required to reward every piece of feedback you get. As a general rule, you should only reward feedback that has been personally helpful for you.\n\n\nIf you do not consider the feedback you receive to be helpful, you may withhold your points for as long as you like. If you have not rewarded anyone in the thread, your first reward will increase in value by 10 rep per day up to a maximum of 50 rep after 5 days. This \"bounty\" system is meant to incentivize feedback even if the request is particularly difficult to fulfill.\n\n\nYou can reward as many or as few of the responses as you like. Just be aware that one person cannot be rewarded more than once in the same thread. Regardless of whether or not you reward anyone, replying to all the feedback you get is considered the polite thing to do.\n\n\nSubmitting content\n\n\nWhat makes a good question?\n\n\nAny questions related to writing are allowed, so long as they do \nnot\n fit the topics or categories mentioned in this section. \nAnything\n is allowed in the weekly Stupid Questions threads, however!\n\n\nTopics to avoid\n\n\n\n\nMotivation.\n Nothing interesting ever comes of a discussion about motivation, staying motivated, getting motivated, or motivating someone else. Besides, it's barely connected with writing. The question \"How can I get motivated to write?\" could be answered in much the same way as if you'd asked it with just about any other activity.\n\n\nIdeas.\n This comes in two flavors: \"How do you get ideas?\" and \"What do you guys think of this idea?\" The answer to the first one has been answered hundreds of times over by authors all across space and time, so you'd do better looking up their answers than asking us for ours. And for the second, virtually no ideas are good or bad \n the goodness or badness comes in the idea's execution. Go write your idea, then come back.\n\n\nBrainstorming.\n Or to put it another way: don't ask us a question that only applies to your specific story. \"I don't know what to do with this character, can anyone help?\" is not really a question, but a thinly-veiled attempt to get the community to do the work for you.\n\n\n\n\nKinds of questions to avoid\n\n\nIn addition to those three major topics, please make sure that the question you're asking is about \nwriting\n, not about \nyourself\n. There's a subtle distinction here, but it makes a huge difference in the quality of conversation that follows. Here are some examples of question formats that can sound like they are about writing, but are actually about the poster.\n\n\n\n\n\"Does anyone else...?\"\n The Internet is a big place. The answer will always be yes.\n\n\n\"Should I...?\"\n It's impossible for anyone to tell you what you should or shouldn't do, especially with something as open-ended as writing. Instead, ask a question that will help you make a more informed decision about whatever you're currently struggling with.\n\n\n\"Is it okay if...?\"\n Rules are there so that you think about them before you break them. If you want to go against the conventional \"rules\" of writing, just do it. You don't need permission from the Internet first!\n\n\n\n\nConsider the question \"Does anyone else outline before they write?\" This is a question to which both \"yes\" and \"no\" are valid responses, but a poll doesn't make for very interesting discussion. On the other hand, the question \"Should I outline before I write?\" is fundamentally unanswerable since it, like so many topics in writing, comes down to personal preference.\n\n\nInstead, consider the question you actually want an answer to. Using our example, it's possible that the poster came to that question because they wanted to start a discussion on the pros and cons of outlining. Instead of approaching the subject in a roundabout way, just start a thread about outlining! You'll get relevant information much more quickly and make a more interesting thread to boot.\n\n\nWant to ask your question anyway?\n\n\nIf you want to ask a question that breaks any of these rules, or you're not sure whether or not your question qualifies, the \nStupid Questions Thread\n is your friend. Unlike questions that start a new thread, pretty much anything goes in Stupid Questions. Find the latest Stupid Questions post and knock yourself out.\n\n\nWhat makes a good content post?\n\n\nUnlike every other category of post, content posts are very open-ended, which makes this question difficult to answer. In general you should lurk the community for a while before attempting your first content post to get a handle on what they'll find interesting.\n\n\nIn general, there are two good types of posts: resources and analysis.\n\n\nA \nresource post\n is a post that links or names one or more outside resources having to do with writing. Often, just linking a resource is not enough, which is part of the reason link posts are disabled on this subreddit. You must also give at least a few sentences of reasoning why you think this resource is a good thing to bring to the community's attention.\n\n\nThat's vague, and intentionally so. Given the proper context, a resource could be anything \n a word reference, a YouTube video, a webapp, even an entire book. You could reference a single thing or a hundred. Expect to be able to defend its usefulness to the community if it is called into question.\n\n\nAn \nanalysis post\n is essentially an essay in which the author has chosen to analyze something related to writing or storytelling. That could be a book, a movie, another essay, a trend, a commonly held belief among writers, a trope, a quirk of grammar \n nearly anything you can imagine. These are often quite long, but provoke discussion that can go on for some time.\n\n\nParticularly good content will be featured on the \nShut Up \n Write Official Blog\n... once it exists.

            "text": "All users can post one feedback request for free. Subsequent requests cost  20 rep  to post.  To request feedback, click the \"Request Feedback\" button in the sidebar, and fill out the appropriate information. It is very important that you read through these guidelines at least once before submitting your request. There's quite a few of them, but following them will make sure that your feedback request is answered more quickly, and will make the experience generally more pleasant for everyone involved.  Once responses start filtering in, you can decide whether or not they were helpful and  reward them accordingly . The integrity of our feedback system is dependent on authors dictating which feedback was genuinely helpful, and is the main source of reputation for the community.  Do's and don'ts for feedback requests  These are  mandatory criteria  and will result in your post being removed if they are not met.  Do:   Include [feedback] somewhere in the title.  Failure to do so will prevent JotBot from recognizing it as a feedback thread, meaning you won't be able to give points to anyone who responds. Also, requests for feedback are not allowed outside of the official feedback system, so your post will be removed.  Put your word count in the title.  Being up-front about your wordcount will help others match up their current attention span with your work.  Explain the purpose of the piece.  Is it an excerpt? A poem? A stand-alone short story? Something you're planning on submitting to a magazine? Context helps tremendously. A middle chapter from a novel can look like a pointless short story if you don't tell anyone what it is.  Format your piece sensibly.  No one wants to read a giant block of text.  Leave comments.  Even if the responses you received on your feedback post aren't worthy of a  (+) , please leave a comment acknowledging that you at least read the responses (and, if you like, why you don't feel the response warrants a reward).   Don't:   DON'T ASK US TO IGNORE ISSUES YOU ALREADY KNOW ARE PRESENT IN YOUR WRITING.  If you know you submission has issues, and you can fix them yourself without outside input,  fix them . A post asking for readers to ignore blatant errors is unacceptable.  DON'T SUBMIT NON-WRITING.  No outlines, no story ideas. We're here to critique writing, not thoughts.  DON'T make a post whose only purpose is to give away reputation points for doing nothing.  Having a thread that's not  really  a feedback thread, but rather an excuse to give out rep points like candy, defeats the whole purpose of a reputation-based system.  DON'T put pieces   500 words in the body of a self-post.  If your piece is under 500 words and you do include it in a self-post, double-check that you've got the formatting right. If you're linking to your piece, make sure wherever you've put it is somewhere readable and convenient for others to use. Stories hosted on sites with eye-gouging design or that require signups will be removed. When in doubt, use  Google Docs  (rich text, Microsoft-Word-esque) or  Pastebin  (plain text only).  DON'T sockpuppet.  Yes, the one-free-post policy means you could theoretically create an infinite number of new accounts and never have to give feedback for the rest of your sorry, miserable life. We're all very proud of you for working that out, but if you're going to try to exploit the reputation system, do it in a more creative way.  DON'T ask if a piece is \"worth continuing,\" or other questions that serve only to seek validation from others.  The only person who can decide if your piece is worth continuing is you. Feedback may be able to help you make the decision, but no individual person can answer that question besides yourself, and if this is the only thing you want feedback on, it's not a worthwhile feedback post.   Not mandatory, but good ideas   Keep your submissions short.  3,500 words is about the maximum you can reasonably expect someone to give a detailed critique about. You can try for longer, but don't expect a miracle.  Avoid posting first drafts.  If you're posting a piece the same day you've spat it out, or without having at least read through it once or twice, you're asking others to do work that you should have done yourself. The purpose of feedback is to pick up where your own efforts left off. Something hot off the typewriter can almost certainly be improved by a second look before asking others to read it.",

            "text": "The best feedback is an accurate description of your reading experience. The more specific you can get about your reactions to the piece and  why  you reacted that way, the better your feedback will be.  General tips for giving feedback:   If you see something, say something.  Keep the poster's specific requests in mind, but don't completely ignore all other problems. If they wanted feedback on pacing but they can't use a semicolon to save their life,  mention it . Even if you have a complaint about a tiny detail, don't assume it was intentional on the author's part or that he/she will catch it themselves later. We only ask that you emphasize the kind of feedback that the poster requested, not disregard all other aspects entirely.  Don't be concerned about being \"right.\"  If you can justify why you think something is working or not working, that's good enough, even if you're the only one who thinks so. Most feedback requests will have multiple people expressing their views on it, so don't worry about biasing the author towards something you're afraid is just your personal taste. Remember, the point of feedback is to get a variety of opinions, so don't concern yourself with \"accuracy.\" Just explain your points and you'll be fine.  Read the majority of the piece before leaving feedback.  Unless there is something blatantly wrong, try to make it through at least half of a piece before giving feedback, especially if the request was for general feedback. Giving feedback on only the first line or sentence usually isn't very helpful!   Your feedback  may be removed and ineligible for earning rep  if it is:   Low effort.  And by this, we don't mean \"how dare you not leave a line-by-line critique.\" General critique and the like is fine, especially if that's what was requested. Sometimes your crit will only be a paragraph or so long, and that's okay! Don't pad your feedback because of this rule. By low effort we mean  incredibly  low effort, like, a single sentence that says \"I didn't read this because it was boring.\" or \"I hate stories about cats.\" Don't do that.  A generic \"I liked it\"/\"I didn't like it\" comment.  You might think you're being nice by telling someone their writing is great, but they're here for data, not validation (hopefully, anyway). Feel free to talk about the specific reasons  why  you liked or didn't like something, but a general yea/nay on a piece doesn't get anyone anywhere. If you find yourself typing out a comment that doesn't go into any detail or explain the reasons about why you felt the way you felt about a piece, stop and come back to it later when you can look at it more objectively.  Completely divergent from the poster's request(s).  Don't lose sight of what was asked for. Double-check the post and see what the requester wanted feedback on, and make sure you've at least tried to touch on what they requested.  Only a reference to privately-given feedback.  Feedback should be public. Comments to the effect of \"check your inbox, I left feedback there\" are not eligible for earning reputation.  A critique of others' subjective feedback.  Contradicting others' feedback is expected   encouraged, even, because it gives the requester a greater variety of opinions to work with   but do it in a way that is clearly directed at the requester, not at the person giving feedback. Otherwise, threads can quickly spiral into arguments about which opinion was \"right.\" That said, if there is something objectively wrong with the feedback (for example, if it violates any of these rules) feel free to link the person to this page and/or report the feedback to mods.",

            "text": "What makes a good question?  Any questions related to writing are allowed, so long as they do  not  fit the topics or categories mentioned in this section.  Anything  is allowed in the weekly Stupid Questions threads, however!  Topics to avoid   Motivation.  Nothing interesting ever comes of a discussion about motivation, staying motivated, getting motivated, or motivating someone else. Besides, it's barely connected with writing. The question \"How can I get motivated to write?\" could be answered in much the same way as if you'd asked it with just about any other activity.  Ideas.  This comes in two flavors: \"How do you get ideas?\" and \"What do you guys think of this idea?\" The answer to the first one has been answered hundreds of times over by authors all across space and time, so you'd do better looking up their answers than asking us for ours. And for the second, virtually no ideas are good or bad   the goodness or badness comes in the idea's execution. Go write your idea, then come back.  Brainstorming.  Or to put it another way: don't ask us a question that only applies to your specific story. \"I don't know what to do with this character, can anyone help?\" is not really a question, but a thinly-veiled attempt to get the community to do the work for you.   Kinds of questions to avoid  In addition to those three major topics, please make sure that the question you're asking is about  writing , not about  yourself . There's a subtle distinction here, but it makes a huge difference in the quality of conversation that follows. Here are some examples of question formats that can sound like they are about writing, but are actually about the poster.   \"Does anyone else...?\"  The Internet is a big place. The answer will always be yes.  \"Should I...?\"  It's impossible for anyone to tell you what you should or shouldn't do, especially with something as open-ended as writing. Instead, ask a question that will help you make a more informed decision about whatever you're currently struggling with.  \"Is it okay if...?\"  Rules are there so that you think about them before you break them. If you want to go against the conventional \"rules\" of writing, just do it. You don't need permission from the Internet first!   Consider the question \"Does anyone else outline before they write?\" This is a question to which both \"yes\" and \"no\" are valid responses, but a poll doesn't make for very interesting discussion. On the other hand, the question \"Should I outline before I write?\" is fundamentally unanswerable since it, like so many topics in writing, comes down to personal preference.  Instead, consider the question you actually want an answer to. Using our example, it's possible that the poster came to that question because they wanted to start a discussion on the pros and cons of outlining. Instead of approaching the subject in a roundabout way, just start a thread about outlining! You'll get relevant information much more quickly and make a more interesting thread to boot.  Want to ask your question anyway?  If you want to ask a question that breaks any of these rules, or you're not sure whether or not your question qualifies, the  Stupid Questions Thread  is your friend. Unlike questions that start a new thread, pretty much anything goes in Stupid Questions. Find the latest Stupid Questions post and knock yourself out.  What makes a good content post?  Unlike every other category of post, content posts are very open-ended, which makes this question difficult to answer. In general you should lurk the community for a while before attempting your first content post to get a handle on what they'll find interesting.  In general, there are two good types of posts: resources and analysis.  A  resource post  is a post that links or names one or more outside resources having to do with writing. Often, just linking a resource is not enough, which is part of the reason link posts are disabled on this subreddit. You must also give at least a few sentences of reasoning why you think this resource is a good thing to bring to the community's attention.  That's vague, and intentionally so. Given the proper context, a resource could be anything   a word reference, a YouTube video, a webapp, even an entire book. You could reference a single thing or a hundred. Expect to be able to defend its usefulness to the community if it is called into question.  An  analysis post  is essentially an essay in which the author has chosen to analyze something related to writing or storytelling. That could be a book, a movie, another essay, a trend, a commonly held belief among writers, a trope, a quirk of grammar   nearly anything you can imagine. These are often quite long, but provoke discussion that can go on for some time.  Particularly good content will be featured on the  Shut Up   Write Official Blog ... once it exists.

            "text": "#shutupandwrite on irc.snoonet.org\n\n\nIRC\n, or \nInternet Relay Chat\n, is a method of talking with people over the Internet via text. It is one of the oldest methods of communication on the Internet, and is still in use to this very day, with thousands of channels spread across hundreds of servers in dozens of networks, each of them about a different subject with a different community and a different set of rules.\n\n\nOur corner of this massive network of communications is known as \n#shutupandwrite\n, hosted on the IRC network known as Snoonet (\nirc.snoonet.org\n). As you might expect, we talk mostly about writing, but the discussion here is a lot more casual than what you'll find on the subreddit.\n\n\nHow to get here\n\n\nClick the \"Join Chat\" button in the sidebar, or click \nthis magical link\n that goes to exactly the same place. Introduce yourself and please be patient \n all chatting is done in real-time and not everyone in the chat has their eyes glued to this one particular window 24/7. Expect to lurk a bit before you get a reply.\n\n\nRules\n\n\nThere aren't many rules in IRC. The main idea is to avoid being extremely irritating to the other participants in chat. Some example of this include:\n\n\n\n\nExcessive use of linebreaks. Every time you press enter, another new message is whisked off to the computer of each and every person you see listed in the chat. Please respect the dark magic involved and don't overdo it by spamming the hell out of it.\n\n\nConstantly asking if \nanyone is around\n. IRC is two-thirds dead air on a good day. It's something you're meant to keep in the background.\n\n\nHaving an excessive number of connections to the same room. If you frequently switch between devices, consider using a \nbouncer\n instead.\n\n\nChanging your nickname a lot. This confuses people about who's who. Then we get more people asking if anyone's around.\n\n\nHaving a client that announces when you are away or back. Apply the \"What if everyone had this?\" principle and then imagine how much channel spam we'd be dealing with.\n\n\nDon't use your nickname as a status message. We don't need to know if you're sleeping or cooking or eating or even writing. Stick to one nickname and we'll all be significantly less confused.\n\n\nComplaining about how stupid the chat is. If you want a discussion about writing, bring it up! It is a chatroom of writers, after all, and it doesn't take much to get us talking about it.\n\n\n\n\nIRC controls\n\n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list of all IRC commands, but these are the commands you'll likely be using the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand [optional] \nrequired\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/nick \nnewnick\n\n\nUse this command to change your display name on IRC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/me \ntext\n\n\nUse this command to use your nickname as part of a sentence. For example, if my name was \nawk\n, \n/me eats a cookie\n would display as \n* awk eats a cookie\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/msg \nuser\n \nmessage\n\n\nSends \nuser\n a private message. In some clients, this will open up a new tab immediately; in others, it won't open a new tab until the person replies. Everything said in that tab will be private between you and the person you are messaging, unlike a channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/msg NickServ HELP REGISTER\n\n\nGives you information on registering your account as a permanent member of Snoonet. This can be handy for a number of reasons, such as reserving your display name so that no one else can use it, or for using certain JotBot functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/msg NickServ IDENTIFY [username] \npassword\n\n\nIf you are registered with Snoonet, use this command to log in. The username parameter is optional and is the name of your Snoonet account (usually the first nickname you registered).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/msg NickServ GHOST \nnick\n \npassword\n\n\nIf another instance of your registered nickname is hanging around, you can use this command to knock it off the server and reclaim your nick. \nnick\n is the nickname you want to kill, and \npassword\n is the password associated with that nickname (your registration password).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJotBot controls\n\n\nYou'll find JotBot in the IRC as well as the subreddit. Here, he announces activity on the subreddit, has a variety of (mostly) useful functions for reference purposes, and runs \nword sprints\n.\n\n\nIf you want to give JotBot a parameter that has spaces in it, include the parameter \"in quotes\". So for example, \n!define some example\n would result in JotBot trying to define \nsome\n and not \nsome example\n; \n!define \"some example\"\n, on the other hand, would work as expected.\n\n\nReference commands\n\n\nYou can use JotBot as a quick reference if you like. His word lookups are powered by Wordnik's free API and isn't the most accurate thing in the world, but he's good for a fast mid-drafting response.\n\n\nAvoid using these commands in a sophomoric fashion (i.e. purposefully trying to get the bot to say or define naughty things).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand [parameter]\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!g [search term]\n\n\nSearches Google for \nsearch term\n and returns the first result if it exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!w [article title]\n\n\nReturns the first few lines from, and a link to, a Wikipedia article with the given title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!trope [trope]\n\n\nReturns a random trope from TVTropes.org, or links to \ntrope\n if one is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!wotd\n\n\nReturns the Word of the Day, as decided by \nWordnik\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!define [word] [definition #]\n\n\nDefines a word. If no definition number is given, returns the first definition. Powered by Wordink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!synonym [word]\n\n\nReturns synonyms of \nword\n.

These word sprints take place every hour on the hour and last for 30 minutes apiece, so you'll always know when one is going or when the next one is.\n\n\nWhile a word sprint is on, all participants draft as quickly as they possibly can, and once it's over, they reveal how much they've written. The \"winner\" of each sprint is whoever wrote the most words. Then everyone gets a half-hour break before it starts over again!\n\n\nWord War Weekend starts at exactly midnight Saturday UTC time and ends at exactly midnight Monday UTC time. For reference, that's a start time of 8pm Friday EST (5pm Friday PST) and an end time of 8pm Sunday EST (5pm Sunday PST).\n\n\nJoin in sometime next weekend! It's a fun way of keeping yourself motivated to write with a little friendly competition.\n\n\nIRC Clients\n\n\nThere are many ways to get into the #shutupandwrite chat. The \nsidebar link\n is the quickest way, but by no means the best. Technically, that link takes you to a client that lives in your web browser known as KiwiIRC. However, there are ways to get to IRC without using a browser at all!\n\n\nThere are a few advantages to this. For one thing, notifications are easier to... well, \nnotice\n when they're happening outside of your browser. Standalone clients are more customizable and a lot more lightweight than a JavaScript beast chugging away in your browser tab. You can also use them to automatically log yourself into services without having to type your password out every time.\n\n\nIf you're on Windows or Linux, \nHexChat\n is a great option. \nColloquy\n is available for OS X and iOS. \nAndChat\n works well for Android phones.\n\n\nWhichever client you use, you'll want to connect to Snoonet (\nirc.snoonet.org\n) and join the \n#shutupandwrite\n channel.\n\n\nModeration\n\n\nFor the most part, \n#shutupandwrite\n is a self-moderating channel. Folks who have a genuine interest in writing generally stick around and folks who are more interested in complaining or stirring up drama generally get bored and leave.\n\n\nModerators (ops and half-ops) don't have a lot to do. Being present and friendly counts for a lot. But on the off chance something does go wrong (or you just feel like messing with people), this section is here for your reference.\n\n\nWhat to do if someone is causing a problem\n\n\nIn this case, \nproblem\n is defined by doing something very disruptive to the community, like harassing a specific person, spamming, or making everyone in the channel crazy uncomfortable for some reason or other.\n\n\n\n\nTell them what they're doing wrong and why it's not a good idea. In 90% of cases, this will solve all your problems. Sometimes folks just don't realize what they're doing!\n\n\nIf they continue, give them an unambiguous, serious-sounding warning.\n\n\nIf they still won't stop doing whatever they're doing, give them a warning \n/kick\n.\n\n\nIf you've reached this point, whoever you're dealing with has a case of incurable douchery, and you can ban them without remorse.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, if someone's come in with the clear intent of being a huge douche like spamming the channel with rude ASCII things, feel free to skip to the banning part.\n\n\nThe Moderator's Arsenal\n\n\nOptional parameters are given in \n[brackets]\n, required parameters are given in \nalligators\n. Some (usually older) clients may require the optional parameters in order to work.\n\n\nChannel kick\n\n\nA virtually worthless power that's more of a polite gesture than anything else. A kick removes the user from the channel, but they are free to instantly rejoin. Great for jokes though.\n\n\nCommand:\n \n/kick [#channel] \nuser\n [reason]\n\n\nChannel ban\n\n\nBans will prevent a user from being able to speak in or rejoin a channel. How they work is a bit tricky, however!\n\n\nCommand:\n \n/mode [#channel] +b \nhost string\n\n\nTo undo:\n \n/mode [#channel] -b \nhost string\n\n\nTo view current bans:\n \n/mode [#channel] +b\n or \n/bans [#channel]\n\n\nInternally, IRC represents each user as a host string in the following format:\n\n\nnick!user@host\n\n\nYou can get this information by performing a \n/whois \nuser\n on someone. The problem with this is that, in most cases, a user can change their \nnick\n or \nuser\n parts of their host string at will, making a full \nnick!user@host\n ban worthless. The \nhost\n part, however, is much more difficult to change and is usually tied to the physical location of the user.\n\n\nFor that reason, all bans should \nwildcard\n the \nnick\n and \nuser\n parts. Any part of a host string with an asterisk (\n*\n) will match any set of characters in place of where the asterisk is. So, for example, a ban using \n*!*@problem.host\n would match any user whose host is \nproblem.host\n, regardless of what they've set their \nuser\n field or \nnick\n to. (\n*!*@*\n, on the other hand, would ban \neveryone\n.)\n\n\nIn some situations, you will want to ban something more specific, like the \nuser\n field along with the \nhost\n field. For example, all the people who use IRCcloud as their bouncer will appear to come from the same host (\nsomename.irccloud.com\n) but have differing \nuser\n fields (\nuid00000\n). In this situation, banning the host (\n*!*@somename.irccloud.com\n) would ban all users of IRCcloud, which you probably don't want to do. Banning the \nuser\n field \nand\n \nhost\n field, however, will only ban that specific IRCcloud user (\n*!uid00000@irccloud.com\n).

Please respect the dark magic involved and don't overdo it by spamming the hell out of it.  Constantly asking if  anyone is around . IRC is two-thirds dead air on a good day. It's something you're meant to keep in the background.  Having an excessive number of connections to the same room. If you frequently switch between devices, consider using a  bouncer  instead.  Changing your nickname a lot. This confuses people about who's who. Then we get more people asking if anyone's around.  Having a client that announces when you are away or back. Apply the \"What if everyone had this?\" principle and then imagine how much channel spam we'd be dealing with.  Don't use your nickname as a status message. We don't need to know if you're sleeping or cooking or eating or even writing. Stick to one nickname and we'll all be significantly less confused.  Complaining about how stupid the chat is.

The username parameter is optional and is the name of your Snoonet account (usually the first nickname you registered).    /msg NickServ GHOST  nick   password  If another instance of your registered nickname is hanging around, you can use this command to knock it off the server and reclaim your nick.  nick  is the nickname you want to kill, and  password  is the password associated with that nickname (your registration password).",

So for example,  !define some example  would result in JotBot trying to define  some  and not  some example ;  !define \"some example\" , on the other hand, would work as expected.  Reference commands  You can use JotBot as a quick reference if you like. His word lookups are powered by Wordnik's free API and isn't the most accurate thing in the world, but he's good for a fast mid-drafting response.  Avoid using these commands in a sophomoric fashion (i.e. purposefully trying to get the bot to say or define naughty things).     Command [parameter]  What it does      !g [search term]  Searches Google for  search term  and returns the first result if it exists.    !w [article title]  Returns the first few lines from, and a link to, a Wikipedia article with the given title.    !trope [trope]  Returns a random trope from TVTropes.org, or links to  trope  if one is provided.    !wotd  Returns the Word of the Day, as decided by  Wordnik .    !define [word] [definition #]  Defines a word.

Use this when you're setting a count that you've previously written.    !c undo  Undoes your previous wordcount.    !c +42  Adds 42 words to your wordcount.    !c -42  Subtracts 42 words from your wordcount.    !c =42  Alias for  !c sneak .     Project commands  JotBot stores information on all the writing currently going on in the community.  Use these commands if you're curious what the rest of the chat is working on, or if you'd like to tell us what you're working on yourself. Checking on the status of other users' projects is  not  considered rude and is actually encouraged! You might find something interesting to read that way.

Creates or edits  Project Title 's description.    !delete \"Project Title\"  Deletes  Project Title . Exact title match is required for deletion.     Sprint commands  Originally inspired by  BattleJesus of NaNoWriMo fame , word sprints are a timed writing exercise in which the goal is to write as quickly as you can.  Use the  wordcount commands  to keep us updated on your progress, and remember to \"sneak\" updates you don't want included in your sprint wordcount!  Sprints are run entirely on the honor system. No one is required to share what they've written during a sprint, although of course they are welcome to do so. If you're stuck and not sure what to write, try out the  !exercise  command.     Command  What it does      !status  Shows the status of the current wordsprint, if there is one.    !sprint  Starts a 30-minute wordsprint 5 minutes from now.    !sprint 15  Starts a 15-minute wordsprint 5 minutes from now.    !sprint 15 2  Starts a 15-minute wordsprint 2 minutes from now.    !join  Joins a wordsprint.    !leave  Leaves a wordsprint.    !final  Finalizes your wordcount. A sprint will not end until all participants have finalized their counts.    !start  (Sprint owner only) Starts a wordsprint immediately.    !close  (Sprint owner only) Ends a wordsprint immediately.

Here's a few guidelines to make sure you're not annoying the heck out of everyone else.\n\n\n\n\nUse headphones.\n Unlike Skype, TeamSpeak has very little in the way of echo cancellation. If our voices are coming out of your speakers, they will go back into your microphone and create a massive, loud, and irritating echo. Please don't do this!\n\n\nUse Push-To-Talk.\n This is a good rule of thumb if you're just starting out. Lots of people have background noise that their microphone picks up on (dogs barking, computer fans running, the tortured screams of basement captives). This isn't so bad if you're talking at the same time, but if your background noise is constant and your microphone is always activated, it means your background noise becomes \nour\n background noise. Nobody wants that.\n\n\nDon't be a creep.\n Lurking is as welcome here as it is anywhere else, but if you're away from your computer, please either duck into the AFK channel or mute yourself. Sitting in a chatroom for hours on end with microphone enabled and never once talking is like having someone stare intently at you from across a room.\n\nIf you're not yet comfortable with using your voice on the Internet, being quiet or communicating through text only isn't a big deal. We only ask that you don't lurk in the chat and \nnever say anything at all ever\n. That's weird.\n\n\n\n\nBad Fanfic Night\n\n\nOn Wednesdays at 8:30pm EST (5:30pm PST), a bunch of us get together to read some terrible fanfic out loud and generally have a good time.\n\n\nIt's purely meant as a for-fun activity to get people comfortable with using the TeamSpeak. Don't expect serious critique or, on the other extreme, any actual malice against fanfic. SU\nW doesn't have anything against fanfiction in general, which is why this is explicitly called \nBad\n Fanfic Night. Fanfic happens to be the easiest writing to get ahold of in large quantities, however.\n\n\nIf you've got a suggestion for Bad Fanfic Night, keep an eye on the subreddit for Bad Fanfic Suggestion threads.

Unlike Skype, TeamSpeak has very little in the way of echo cancellation. If our voices are coming out of your speakers, they will go back into your microphone and create a massive, loud, and irritating echo. Please don't do this!  Use Push-To-Talk.  This is a good rule of thumb if you're just starting out. Lots of people have background noise that their microphone picks up on (dogs barking, computer fans running, the tortured screams of basement captives). This isn't so bad if you're talking at the same time, but if your background noise is constant and your microphone is always activated, it means your background noise becomes  our  background noise. Nobody wants that.  Don't be a creep.  Lurking is as welcome here as it is anywhere else, but if you're away from your computer, please either duck into the AFK channel or mute yourself. Sitting in a chatroom for hours on end with microphone enabled and never once talking is like having someone stare intently at you from across a room. \nIf you're not yet comfortable with using your voice on the Internet, being quiet or communicating through text only isn't a big deal. We only ask that you don't lurk in the chat and  never say anything at all ever . That's weird.",

            "text": "On Wednesdays at 8:30pm EST (5:30pm PST), a bunch of us get together to read some terrible fanfic out loud and generally have a good time.  It's purely meant as a for-fun activity to get people comfortable with using the TeamSpeak. Don't expect serious critique or, on the other extreme, any actual malice against fanfic. SU W doesn't have anything against fanfiction in general, which is why this is explicitly called  Bad  Fanfic Night. Fanfic happens to be the easiest writing to get ahold of in large quantities, however.  If you've got a suggestion for Bad Fanfic Night, keep an eye on the subreddit for Bad Fanfic Suggestion threads. Be sure to vote for fanfics you'd like to see read!",
